# King-Gizzard-Database


This is a project where I create a database and a web app for interacting with it where I track all of the King Gizzard live shows
I've listened to. 

Currently trying to implement:
-SQL(Lite?) database to hold the data
-Simple website to interact with it
-Adding previously listened to shows to the database
-Searching for songs or song sequences
-Filtering by year, city, venue, country
-Filtering by sound quality and source

In future:

-Adding information about the albums that the songs are on to determine frequencies

-Adding information on noteworthy teases and filtering by them

-Linking queries for famous sequences to checkboxes (Inner Cell trilogy, Mind Fuzz Medley, etc)

-Random show/random song

-Analyzing which setlist was closest to my tastes
